A developer has installed a KinD cluster locally and wants to use an NGINX deployment to test his new web app.  
They inform you that they have used various Internet sources to create the deployment but when attempting to `curl localhost:80` he gets a `503` error returned rather than the expected Welcome to nginx! landing page.  They have asked you for help, can you fix the deployment and get the NGINX welcome screen when performing `curl localhost:80`?
