A developer has installed a KinD cluster locally and wants to use a NGINX deployment to test their new web app.  
They inform you that they have used various Internet sources to create the deployment but when attempting to `curl localhost:80` they receive a `503` error returned rather than the expected `Welcome to nginx!` landing page.  They have asked you for help, can you fix the deployment and get the NGINX welcome screen when performing `curl localhost:80`?
